Explicit return when the Minion is not connected
------------------------------------------------

When using *salt-sproxy* to execute against running (Proxy) Minions, it may 
happen sometimes that the Minion is not available for various reasons (e.g., 
key accepted, but the service is not fully started, etc.). When this happens, 
*salt-sprox* now returns an explicit message ``Minion did not return. [Not 
connected]`` for better feedback on the command line.
